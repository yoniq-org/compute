# LLM Inference Bench Setup

Use this skill to prepare and run `llm_decode_bench.py` against an **already running** SGLang or vLLM instance, normally after an inference launch script has reached API readiness.

## Scope and required inputs

The caller MUST supply, for each model/run:

- `launch_script`: the inference script used to start this instance, wherever it is located.
- `model_context_limit`: the explicit context limit in tokens for this model/run. Never infer it from a model name, GPU memory, or a previous model's benchmark. Normalize supplied units before calculating: `k`/`K` = 1,024 tokens; `m`/`M` = 1,048,576 tokens. A bare integer is an exact token count, not a rounded marketing label.
- `gpu_type`: the supplied filename label, such as `h200`. Do not guess this label from the machine's inventory.

Read the launch script and any referenced configuration needed to obtain GPU quantity, server port, API key, host, and served model name. Resolve actual launch arguments/interactive selections from the known invocation or launch logs rather than assuming defaults were used. Request only required inputs that remain unavailable; do not start a guessed benchmark.

This skill does not create or retune an inference recipe, change an engine environment, perform a GPU-memory sweep, restart the inference server, or stop it after the benchmark. Changes are confined to the benchmark checkout, its custom Python environment, and benchmark output. Broader recipe work requires a separate explicit request and the applicable recipe/source skills.

Creating, updating, or inspecting this skill is **not** authorization to run a benchmark or create benchmark result files. Execute the run workflow only when the caller explicitly requests a benchmark against a running instance and the required inputs are available.

## 1. Check the benchmark directory first

Before any benchmark import, patch, help command, or run, check:

```text
$HOME/llm-inference-bench
```

- If the directory is absent, clone exactly `https://github.com/local-inference-lab/llm-inference-bench.git` into that path, not into the current recipes directory and not into a nested `llm-inference-bench/llm-inference-bench` directory.
- If it exists, reuse it and preserve local changes. Do not automatically pull, reset, clean, reclone, or overwrite it.
- If the path is a file/broken link, or the directory lacks `llm_decode_bench.py`, report a setup failure; do not delete the conflicting path.
- Use the checkout's own `README.md`, dependency declarations when present, and `llm_decode_bench.py` as the authority for its installed CLI and behavior. Inspect the current source rather than assuming upstream line numbers are stable.

## 2. Prepare the exact custom UV environment

Use only:

```text
$HOME/env_custom-uv/bin/python
```

Reuse `$HOME/env_custom-uv` if usable. If absent, create it with `uv venv` and Python 3.10 or newer. The hyphenated `env_custom-uv` path is intentional: do not substitute `env_custom_uv`, a system interpreter, or the inference server's environment. Do not replace an existing unusable directory automatically.

The upstream benchmark documents `httpx`, `rich`, and `psutil`. Ensure these imports work in this environment, installing missing dependencies with `uv pip install --python "$HOME/env_custom-uv/bin/python" ...`. Resolve any additional demonstrated missing package against the current checkout's dependency instructions, install into this same environment, and recheck imports. Do not unnecessarily upgrade already working packages or install into an engine environment. `uv` and `git` must be available; report an unresolved setup prerequisite rather than continuing with another environment.

The following Bash setup sequence is idempotent for a valid existing checkout/environment.

```bash
set -e
BENCH_REPO="$HOME/llm-inference-bench"
BENCH_ENV="$HOME/env_custom-uv"

if [ ! -d "$BENCH_REPO" ]; then
    if [ -e "$BENCH_REPO" ] || [ -L "$BENCH_REPO" ]; then
        printf '%s\n' "Setup failed: $BENCH_REPO exists but is not a usable directory." >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    git clone https://github.com/local-inference-lab/llm-inference-bench.git "$BENCH_REPO"
fi
if [ ! -f "$BENCH_REPO/llm_decode_bench.py" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' "Setup failed: llm_decode_bench.py is missing from $BENCH_REPO." >&2
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -e "$BENCH_ENV" ] && [ ! -L "$BENCH_ENV" ]; then
    uv venv --python '>=3.10' "$BENCH_ENV"
fi
if [ ! -x "$BENCH_ENV/bin/python" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' "Setup failed: $BENCH_ENV is not a usable Python environment." >&2
    exit 1
fi
"$BENCH_ENV/bin/python" -c 'import sys; sys.exit(0 if sys.version_info >= (3, 10) else "Python 3.10+ is required")'
uv pip install --python "$BENCH_ENV/bin/python" httpx rich psutil
"$BENCH_ENV/bin/python" -c 'import httpx, rich, psutil'
```

## 3. Calculate the model-specific context lists

Recalculate for **every model/run**. The ordered standard points start at 8K and double:

```text
8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,512k,1024k,...
```

Include **256k**. Do not skip it between 128k and 512k. Keep every standard point up to the endpoint, then append the exact endpoint if it is not already present. Do not insert 0K, duplicate endpoints, round an endpoint upward, or cap the ladder at 128K/1024K when the supplied limit is larger.

Use precisely:

```text
decode_contexts = context_points(model_context_limit - 4096 - 1024)
prefill_contexts = context_points(model_context_limit)
```

The decode reserve is 4,096 generation tokens plus 1,024 safety tokens. Do not subtract it from the prefill sweep. Both formulas use the same `model_context_limit`, but prefill MUST be calculated independently, never from the decode budget. Neither endpoint may be rounded. Generate both argument strings for every run; NEVER copy them from an old benchmark JSON or a hand-maintained model-specific list.

Reference calculation, with integer token counts:

```python
def context_points(limit: int) -> list[int]:
    if limit < 8 * 1024:
        raise ValueError("Context budget cannot support the required 8K starting point")
    points = []
    point = 8 * 1024
    while point <= limit:
        points.append(point)
        point *= 2
    if points[-1] != limit:
        points.append(limit)
    return points


def context_csv(points: list[int]) -> str:
    return ",".join(f"{point // 1024}k" if point % 1024 == 0 else str(point) for point in points)


def benchmark_contexts(model_context_limit: int) -> tuple[str, str]:
    decode_contexts = context_points(model_context_limit - 4096 - 1024)
    prefill_contexts = context_points(model_context_limit)
    return context_csv(decode_contexts), context_csv(prefill_contexts)


def validate_context_lists(
    model_context_limit: int,
    decode_contexts: list[int],
    prefill_contexts: list[int],
) -> None:
    """Check integer lists parsed from the actual or saved invocation."""
    expected_decode = context_points(model_context_limit - 4096 - 1024)
    expected_prefill = context_points(model_context_limit)
    if decode_contexts != expected_decode:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Decode contexts: expected {expected_decode}, got {decode_contexts}"
        )
    if prefill_contexts != expected_prefill:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Prefill contexts: expected {expected_prefill}, got {prefill_contexts}"
        )
```

If the decode budget is below 8,192 tokens, report that this sweep cannot run as specified; do not silently introduce a smaller starting point. For a non-K-aligned limit, keep the final point as an exact decimal token count.

Required examples:

| Model context limit | `--contexts` | `--prefill-contexts` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 131072 (128K) | `8k,16k,32k,64k,123k` | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k` |
| 262144 (256K) | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,251k` | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k` |
| 320000 (exact, non-K-aligned) | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,314880` | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,320000` |
| 524288 (512K) | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,507k` | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,512k` |
| 1048576 (1M / 1024K) | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,512k,1019k` | `8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k,512k,1024k` |

**Mandatory endpoint gate:** use the checkout's actual argument/token parser to obtain the integer lists from the invocation that will run, then execute `validate_context_lists` with the supplied model limit. Abort before the load test on a mismatch. Checking only freshly generated reference lists against themselves does not verify the executed command. Repeat this check against the saved invocation before publishing results (Step 7).

For a 1M limit, the required final pair is **1019k decode / 1024k prefill**: **1,043,456 / 1,048,576 tokens**. Decode endpoints of `1000k`, `1020k`, or `1024k` are wrong; prefill endpoints of `1000k`, `1019k`, or `1020k` are also wrong. A correct prefill endpoint does not excuse an incorrect decode endpoint, or vice versa.

## 4. Enable long contexts in the benchmark checkout

Inspect and, where necessary, edit **`$HOME/llm-inference-bench/llm_decode_bench.py`**, not an installed engine module or the inference recipe.

Both `--contexts` and `--prefill-contexts` MUST accept comma-separated integer/K-suffixed values beyond 128K, including 256k, 512k, 1019k, and 1024k. Reuse existing flags and token parsing; do not add duplicate arguments. Current upstream `parse_token_value` already handles arbitrary K-suffixed values, so parser acceptance alone does not prove that the requested rows will run.

Inspect argument parsing, prefill/decode list construction, prompt generation, scheduling, and JSON output for fixed ceilings or silent row filtering. A known upstream prefill ceiling inside `run_benchmark` is:

```python
max_prefill = min(131072, server_context_length - 64) if server_context_length > 0 else 131072
```

When this implementation is present, replace that assignment with:

```python
max_prefill = (
    server_context_length
    if server_context_length > 0
    else max(context_lengths + PREFILL_CANDIDATES, default=0)
)
```

This removes the hard-coded 128K ceiling and retains the exact model-limit endpoint in the prefill selection. Merely removing `min(131072, ...)` while retaining `server_context_length - 64` still drops the required 256k/1024k endpoint and is incomplete. When server metadata is unavailable, use the explicitly requested points rather than a fixed 128K fallback.

Adapt the minimal change to the actual checkout if upstream has moved this code. If long-context support is already correct, preserve it; do not reapply or duplicate a patch. Leave unrelated 131072 values, scoring profiles, timeouts, benchmark defaults, concurrency, calibration, request generation, and engine/KV safety checks unchanged. Do not globally replace the number 131072.

Verify, before the load test:

- The actual parser accepts all required flags, and `validate_context_lists` passes on its integer context lists, with `max_tokens == 4096` and `token_targeting == "estimate"`.
- After applying server metadata and the actual context-selection logic, decode and prefill planning retain every requested point, including prefill at the exact model limit. Additional integrated-prefill decode points are allowed; the decode endpoint MUST NOT replace the full-limit prefill point.
- There is no fixed 128K ceiling, `server_context_length - 64` ceiling, rounded ceiling, or exclusive upper-bound filter silently removing the full-limit prefill point on the exercised path. Parser acceptance alone does not prove this.
- The edited Python compiles and the benchmark's `--help` works in the custom environment.

The benchmark can offer to auto-update itself before parsing arguments. **Decline the update with `n`**: accepting it can overwrite the local long-context change. Do not add an invented no-update flag. If the checkout is intentionally updated later, reinspect and revalidate the support before benchmarking.

### Full-limit prefill caveat

`--token-targeting estimate` requests approximate prompt sizes; a row label is not proof of an exact token count. Prefill probes still generate a first token, and tokenizer/chat-template overhead can cause a full-limit request to be rejected. Preserve the requested prefill endpoint and existing request safety behavior. Report actual `prompt_tokens` when available and any context-limit rejection. Do not silently reduce the endpoint, switch token-targeting modes, disable validation, or label a skipped/rejected row successful.

## 5. Resolve the running instance and output filename

Read the launcher without executing or sourcing it merely to obtain variables: sourcing a recipe can start another inference server.

For `recipes/` conventions:

- GPU quantity normally comes from `DEFAULT_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE`; the resolved launch may use `TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE_VALUE` after an argument/interactive override.
- Port normally comes from `DEFAULT_PORT`; the resolved launch uses `INFERENCE_PORT`.
- `API_KEY` can contain the entire fragment `--api-key YOUR_API_KEY`; pass only the key value to the benchmark, not the fragment.
- `SERVED_MODEL_NAME` identifies the API model, which may differ from `MODEL_REPO`.

For other launchers, read their equivalent explicit GPU count/device selection and `--tp`/`--tensor-parallel-size`, port, and authentication configuration. GPU quantity must describe GPUs used by **this launched script/instance**, not all GPUs installed in the machine, a draft-model count, or requested benchmark concurrency. Resolve explicit launch overrides and more complex parallel layouts from the script/invocation/logs; do not guess a count from an unrelated process.

Match the actual port and API key. Use 8000 and `YOUR_API_KEY` only when they match the launch. If authentication is explicitly disabled, pass an empty key rather than inventing one. Use `--host` for a non-default endpoint and `--model` for the exact served model when auto-detection would be ambiguous. Never log a real API key in the final command/report; redact it there while passing the real value to the process.

Confirm authenticated `/v1/models` readiness and the intended served model before sending benchmark traffic. Cross-check the supplied model context against the configured running limit when it is available. A smaller running limit is a configuration mismatch to report, not permission to silently shrink the supplied sweep or restart/retune the server.

Write the benchmark output to `/tmp` first:

```text
/tmp/<launch-script-stem>_<gpu-type>x<gpu-qty>.json
```

Remove only the launch script's final extension; preserve its other spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and variant suffixes. Validate `gpu_type` as a filename label without path separators (for example, `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`) and GPU quantity as a positive integer.

The **only publication destination** is the matching recipe's directory, expressed relative to the caller's checkout:

```text
recipes/<repo-match>/llm-inference-bench/<launch-script-stem>_<gpu-type>x<gpu-qty>.json
```

Resolve `<repo-match>` from the actual launcher's recipe directory, not from the served-model alias or `MODEL_REPO`. For example, a launcher under `recipes/incoai/` publishes under `recipes/incoai/llm-inference-bench/` even if its target checkpoint belongs to another organization. NEVER publish to the shared `recipes/llm-inference-bench/` directory.

Publisher directories directly under `recipes/` are lowercase. Reuse the launcher's actual lowercase directory; NEVER create a mixed-case publisher directory from its filename or `MODEL_REPO`. Preserve launcher and benchmark filename capitalization and nested directory names; do not lowercase the entire path.

Resolve and retain the launcher path relative to its actual invocation directory before working in `/tmp`. Derive the checkout and destination from that resolved path; do not embed a workstation-specific checkout root or resolve `recipes/` against an unrelated current directory. The helper below covers the standard `recipes/<repo-match>/<launcher>` layout. For an external/nonstandard launcher, locate its unique corresponding recipe directory first; report an unresolved or ambiguous mapping instead of guessing a destination.

Reference path construction once these inputs are resolved:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path


def benchmark_output_path(launch_script: str, gpu_type: str, gpu_qty: int) -> Path:
    if not isinstance(gpu_type, str) or not re.fullmatch(r"[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*", gpu_type):
        raise ValueError("A supplied, filename-safe GPU type is required")
    if type(gpu_qty) is not int or gpu_qty < 1:
        raise ValueError("GPU quantity must be a positive integer resolved from the launch script")
    script = Path(launch_script).expanduser().absolute()
    return Path("/tmp") / f"{script.stem}_{gpu_type}x{gpu_qty}.json"


def benchmark_result_path(launch_script: str, gpu_type: str, gpu_qty: int) -> Path:
    script = Path(launch_script).expanduser().resolve()
    recipe_directory = script.parent
    if (
        recipe_directory.parent.name != "recipes"
        or recipe_directory.name == "llm-inference-bench"
    ):
        raise ValueError("Resolve a unique recipes/<repo-match>/ directory before publishing")
    filename = benchmark_output_path(launch_script, gpu_type, gpu_qty).name
    return recipe_directory / "llm-inference-bench" / filename
```

For example:

```text
recipes/qwen/vllm_Qwen_Qwen3.8-27B-FP8.sh
  + gpu_type=h200, gpu_qty=1
  -> /tmp/vllm_Qwen_Qwen3.8-27B-FP8_h200x1.json
  -> publish only after success: recipes/qwen/llm-inference-bench/vllm_Qwen_Qwen3.8-27B-FP8_h200x1.json
```

If an output already exists in `/tmp`, preserve it before replacing it, using a clearly identified backup. Keep the requested filename unchanged, do not silently resume a previous benchmark, and never treat stale JSON as evidence for a new run. Record run start time, the scratch output path, and the resolved publisher-local destination before benchmarking.

## 6. Run the real benchmark

Use the custom environment's explicit interpreter, not whichever `python3` happens to be active. Required arguments are:

```bash
"$HOME/env_custom-uv/bin/python" "$HOME/llm-inference-bench/llm_decode_bench.py" \
  --port "$PORT" \
  --api-key "$API_KEY_VALUE" \
  --prefill-contexts "$PREFILL_CONTEXTS" \
  --contexts "$DECODE_CONTEXTS" \
  --max-tokens 4096 \
  --token-targeting estimate \
  --output "$OUTPUT"
```

`PORT`, `API_KEY_VALUE`, both context strings, and `OUTPUT` must already be resolved by the steps above. Preserve the upstream standard concurrency and duration unless the caller explicitly asks otherwise. Do not add `--skip-prefill`, `--prefill-only`, `--standalone-prefill`, reduced contexts, or a short benchmark as a substitute for the requested run.

The current default prefill mode combines nonzero decode scout contexts with the supplied `--prefill-contexts`. Consequently a 1M run can also contain a 1019K integrated-prefill row in addition to the requested prefill ladder ending at 1024K; this is not a reason to remove either endpoint or change measurement mode.

Concrete 256K example, only when these launcher values match the instance:

```bash
"$HOME/env_custom-uv/bin/python" "$HOME/llm-inference-bench/llm_decode_bench.py" \
  --port 8000 \
  --api-key YOUR_API_KEY \
  --prefill-contexts 8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,256k \
  --contexts 8k,16k,32k,64k,128k,251k \
  --max-tokens 4096 \
  --token-targeting estimate \
  --output /tmp/vllm_Qwen_Qwen3.8-27B-FP8_h200x1.json
```

Run the interactive/long-lived benchmark in a supervised interactive process or terminal session using its actual interpreter and argument vector. Observe logs/TUI, decline self-updates and stale-run resume prompts, retain process output, and wait for completion. Process creation is not success. Do not kill the inference server when the benchmark exits or fails. Sequentially benchmark distinct models/configurations; concurrent load tests against one instance contaminate results.

For each benchmark, truncate `/tmp/benchmark.log` immediately before launch and tee the benchmark's combined stdout/stderr to it, preserving the benchmark exit status with `set -o pipefail`. External watchers streaming this log MUST use `tail -F /tmp/benchmark.log` (with capital `-F`, `--follow=name --retry`) so log monitoring continues uninterrupted across runs and file truncations. During benchmark management and cleanup, NEVER use broad substring pattern matches such as `pkill -f benchmark`, which terminate watcher processes like `tail -F /tmp/benchmark.log`. Target only the benchmark Python interpreter specifically, for example `pkill -f 'python.*llm_decode_bench\.py'`.

## 7. Decide success versus early failure

Always inspect **both process outcome and fresh benchmark results**. Current upstream can return exit code 0 after a connection failure with `No results collected.`, and can save partial JSON after interruption. Neither exit code 0 nor `Results saved` alone proves success.

The cookbook recipe's 16 GiB (16,384 MiB) per-GPU reserve applies only at settled API readiness after model loading, warmup, and graph capture, before workload traffic. Do not require that reserve during or after benchmarking, including after the server becomes idle. Lower free memory alone is neither a benchmark failure nor grounds to retune the server or withhold an otherwise completed result. Record later memory readings as telemetry; continue to classify actual OOMs, crashes, request errors, invalid measurements, and incomplete sweeps under the rules below.

Inspect the current checkout's output schema. Known fields include `metadata`, `results`, `prefill`, `event_log`, and `startup_diagnostics.args`. Decode cells can contain `failure_reason`, `num_errors`, `loop_detected`, `capacity_limited`, and negative `aggregate_tps` sentinels. Some capacity-skipped cells are omitted from exported `results`, so reconcile coverage with logs/events and the expected context/concurrency matrix; do not simply demand that the number of JSON rows equals the raw matrix size.

**Mandatory saved-result endpoint gate, before declaring success or copying JSON:**

1. Parse the saved invocation's context lists as integer token counts and run `validate_context_lists` again using the originally supplied model limit. In the current schema these arguments are `startup_diagnostics.args.contexts` and `startup_diagnostics.args.prefill_contexts`; cross-check corresponding metadata when present. A filename, rounded TUI label, or exit code 0 is not endpoint evidence.
2. Account for every requested prefill point, especially the exact model-limit point, using numeric context keys in `prefill` and the matching logs/events. The current full-limit entry is `prefill[str(model_context_limit)]`. Inspect its timing, actual `prompt_tokens` when available, and outcome; a label alone does not prove a successful measurement. A missing result needs evidence of an attempted request, rejection, or legitimate capacity skip. An extra integrated 1019k row cannot replace the required 1024k row. Estimated prompt counts need not equal the target; retain the full-limit caveat above.
3. Wrong argument lists or unexplained, silently omitted prefill work mean the requested sweep did not complete, even if the process exited normally. Do not publish that output or overwrite an existing final JSON. A documented rejected request or legitimate capacity skip remains a measurement issue under the classifications below, never a successful measurement or permission to lower the requested endpoint.

Classify the run explicitly:

- **SUCCESS (completed sweep)**: normal completion of the requested sweep with fresh, parseable JSON at the requested path matching this model and invocation. A completed sweep remains a successful benchmark run when individual measurements are invalid or capacity-limited. Report every request error, loop-invalid measurement, context rejection, missing sample, and capacity/concurrency skip separately; do not label those cells successful.
- **FAILED EARLY**: setup/dependency/patch/readiness failure, or an authentication error, connection failure, context rejection, crash, interruption, timeout, or other error that prevents the requested sweep from completing. Give the failing stage, exit code when launched, exact first relevant error, last completed context/concurrency if any, and whether partial JSON/checkpoint files exist. If not launched, state that clearly.
- **MEASUREMENT ISSUES**: record invalid measurements, request/loop errors, missing or rejected prefill samples, and legitimate capacity skips independently of run completion. Leave the benchmark failure or measurement-issues field blank only when no issues were recorded. A partial sweep or unexplained missing work is not successful completion.

If estimated full-limit prefill fails, report that failure rather than quietly omitting the endpoint. Keep genuine partial output for diagnosis; do not invent an empty success JSON, rewrite error measurements into successful ones, or delete a user's benchmark checkout/environment after a failed run.

Only after the run is classified **SUCCESS (completed sweep)** and both endpoint gates pass, create the resolved `recipes/<repo-match>/llm-inference-bench/` directory if needed and copy the single final JSON from `/tmp` **only** to that directory, preserving its filename. Verify that the published copy is byte-for-byte identical to the completed source before reporting publication or replacement of an existing result.

NEVER create or update a central `recipes/llm-inference-bench/` copy, fan out to multiple directories, or publish beside an unrelated external launcher. All checkout paths here are relative conventions to resolve from the actual recipe location, not fixed installation paths.

Benchmarks MUST run exclusively in `/tmp`. NEVER copy, transfer, or synchronize any `.resume.json`, checkpoint, intermediate, partial, interrupted, or aborted output into a recipe results directory. Only the single final completed `.json` is copied once the entire requested sweep is 100% finished.

## Final report

Lead with **SUCCESS (completed sweep)** or **FAILED EARLY**, explicitly listing any measurement issues separately, followed by:

- Inference launch script, served model/engine, supplied context limit, host/port, and GPU label/count with its launcher source.
- Endpoint-gate verdict and exact decode/prefill argument lists, including expected versus saved endpoints as integer token counts and the fixed `--max-tokens 4096 --token-targeting estimate` settings.
- Checkout reused/cloned, long-context edit applied/already supported, environment reused/created, and packages installed.
- Actual command with any real API key redacted, exit status, and whether the run completed normally.
- Scratch JSON output path and checkout-relative publisher-local destination, whether the result is fresh, valid, complete, or partial, and whether the final copied bytes match; any preserved prior-output backup.
- Highest requested versus successfully measured decode/prefill contexts. For the full-limit prefill target, report its numeric target, actual `prompt_tokens` when available, and measured/rejected/skipped outcome with evidence; include all other skipped or failed cells.
- For failure: stage, first relevant error, progress reached, and partial-output/checkpoint location or explicit absence.

Do not claim that a benchmark ran when only setup, parser checks, or command preparation were performed.
